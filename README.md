# AP-Assignment
This project contains the coursework for my Advanced Programming module. The aim of the assignment is to develop a 
program for a basic zoo management system that contains information about animals, pens and zookeepers.

The code used to write the program makes use of object-oriented concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. I have 
tried following a model-view-controller pattern whilst writing this code.

Tests have also been written for the code though this is not extensive.
